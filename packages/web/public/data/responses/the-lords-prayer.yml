content: |
  Our Father, who art in heaven
  hallowed be thy name.

  Thy kingdom come,
  Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven

  Give us this day our daily bread

  and forgive us our trespasses
  as we forgive those who trespass against us

  And lead us not into temptation
  but deliver us from evil

  For thine is the kingdom, and the power
  and glory forever
  
  Amen
