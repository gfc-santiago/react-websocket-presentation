  Dismissal

  Beloved, May God bless you with courage
  to turn from the riches the world values,
  
  trust to choose God’s economy over the world’s economy, 
  and opportunities to discover God’s abundance 
  over and over and over again.

  Let us go, then, separately but together, 
  remember the three simple rules being a United Methodist. 
  
  “Do no harm. Do good. Stay in love with God”
  {sm}- John Wesley

  Benediction
  Numbers 6:22-26

  The LORD bless you and keep you

  the LORD make his face shine on you
  and be gracious to you;

  the LORD turn his face toward you
  and give you peace.

  Amen
