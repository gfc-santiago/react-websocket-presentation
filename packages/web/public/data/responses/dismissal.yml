  Dismissal

  God invites us into his future, where the one
  who makes all things new has made his home among us.
  
  We are called and chosen,
  together embraced by the God in whom tears,
  
  mourning, crying, pain and
  even death will be no more.
  
  Let us go, then, separately but together,
  remember the three simple rules being a United Methodist.

  “Do no harm. Do good. Stay in love with God”
  {sm}- John Wesley

  Benediction
  Numbers 6:22-26

  The LORD bless you and keep you

  the LORD make his face shine on you
  and be gracious to you;

  the LORD turn his face toward you
  and give you peace.

  Amen
