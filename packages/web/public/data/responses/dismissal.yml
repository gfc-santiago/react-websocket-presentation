  Dismissal

  Go, now, blessed with a passion that refines,
  molds, and shapes each of our hearts to reflect
  
  God's glorious love that transforms despair into hope,
  violence into peace, and distress into flourishing.
  
  Let us go, then, separately but together,
  remember the three simple rules being a United Methodist.

  “Do no harm. Do good. Stay in love with God”
  {sm}- John Wesley

  Benediction
  Numbers 6:22-26

  The LORD bless you and keep you

  the LORD make his face shine on you
  and be gracious to you;

  the LORD turn his face toward you
  and give you peace.

  Amen
