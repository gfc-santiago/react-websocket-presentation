  Go, now, in the blessing of God's promise
  and in the assurance that our expectant joy will find its fulfillment
  
  in the God who was, who is, and who will be with us always.
  
  Let us go, then, separately but together,
  remember the three simple rules being a United Methodist.

  “Do no harm. Do good. Stay in love with God”
  {sm}- John Wesley

  Benediction
  Numbers 6:22-26

  The LORD bless you and keep you

  the LORD make his face shine on you
  and be gracious to you;

  the LORD turn his face toward you
  and give you peace.

  Amen
