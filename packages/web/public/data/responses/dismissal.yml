  Advent invites each of us into a new way of living
  in a world to which the kin-dom of God has come and is yet coming.
  
  Go, now, blessed with the gift of togetherness,
  for it is only in being truly present with God
  
  and one another that we live as followers
  of the coming Messiah.
  
  Let us go, then, separately but together,
  remember the three simple rules being a United Methodist.

  “Do no harm. Do good. Stay in love with God”
  {sm}- John Wesley

  Benediction
  Numbers 6:22-26

  The LORD bless you and keep you

  the LORD make his face shine on you
  and be gracious to you;

  the LORD turn his face toward you
  and give you peace.

  Amen
