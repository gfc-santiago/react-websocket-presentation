  Prayer of Declaration
  {sm}(The Community in Unison)
  
  I declare I will experience God's faithfulness
  I will not worry; I will not doubt

  I will keep my trust in Him
  knowing that he will not fail me.

  I will give birth
  to every promise I put in my heart

  and I will become everything
  He created me to be

  I declare I have the grace
  I need for today.

  In Jesus Name I pray
  Amen.
