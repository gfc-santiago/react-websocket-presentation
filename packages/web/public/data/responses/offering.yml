    Honor the LORD with your wealth,
    with the first fruits of all your crops

    then your barns will be filled to overflowing,
    and your vats will brim over with new wine.

    Give, and it will be given to you.

    A good measure, pressed down, shaken together
    and running over, will be poured into your lap.
    
    For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.‚Äù
