  V1: |
    Here is where I lay it down
    Every burden, every crown

    This is my surrender
    This is my surrender

    Here is where I lay it down
    Every lie and every doubt

    This is my surrender
  V2: |
    Here is where I lay it down
    You are all I'm chasing now

    This is my surrender
    This is my surrender

    Here is where I lay it down
    You are all I'm chasing now

    This is my surrender
  C: |
    And I will make room for You
    To do whatever You want to

    To do whatever You want to

  B: |
    Shake up the ground of all my tradition
    Break down the walls of all my religion

    Your way is better
    Oh, Your way is better
