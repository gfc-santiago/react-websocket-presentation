  V1: |
    Hark the herald angels sing
    Glory to the newborn King!

    Peace on earth and mercy mild
    God and sinners reconciled

    Joyful, all ye nations rise
    Join the triumph of the skies

    With the angelic host proclaim:
    Christ is born in Bethlehem

  R: |
    Hark! The herald angels sing
    Glory to the newborn King!

  V2: |
    Christ, by highest heaven adored,
    Christ, the everlasting Lord,

    late in time behold him come,
    offspring of the Virgin's womb:

    veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
    hail th'incarnate Deity,

    pleased with us in flesh to dwell,
    Jesus, our Immanuel.
  
  V3: |
    Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
    Hail the Sun of Righteousness!

    Light and life to all he brings,
    risen with healing in his wings.

    Mild he lays his glory by,
    born that we no more may die,

    born to raise us from the earth,
    born to give us second birth.
