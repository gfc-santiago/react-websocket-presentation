  V1: |
    Christ is my firm foundation
    The rock on which I stand

    When everything around me is shaken
    I've never been more glad

    That I put my faith in Jesus
    'Cause He's never let me down

    He's faithful through generations
    So why would He fail now?
  
  C1: |
    He won't
  
  C2: |
    He won't

    He won't fail

  V2: |
    I've still got joy in chaos
    I've got peace that makes no sense

    So I won't be going under
    I'm not held by my own strength

    'Cause I've built my life on Jesus
    He's never let me down

    He's faithful in every season
    So why would He fail now?

  B: |
    Rain came and wind blew
    But my house was built on You

    I'm safe with You
    I'm gonna make it through

  B2: |
    Yeah, I'm gonna make it through
    'Cause my house is built on you
