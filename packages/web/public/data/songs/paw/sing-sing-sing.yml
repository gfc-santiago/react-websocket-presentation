    Sing, sing, sing
    And make music with the heavens

    We will sing, sing, sing
    Grateful that You hear us

    When we shout Your praise
    Lift high the name of Jesus

  V1: |
    What's not to love about You?
    Heaven and Earth adore You

    Kings and kingdoms bow down
    Son of God, You are the One

    You are the One

  V2: |
    You are the love that frees us
    You are the light that leads us
    
    like a fire burning
    Son of God, You are the One
    
    You are the One we're living for
