  V1: |
    I've got a river of living water
    A fountain that never will run dry

    It's an open heaven You're releasing
    And we will never be denied
  P: |
    'Cause we're stirrin' up deep, deep wells
    We're stirrin' up deep, deep waters
    
    We're gonna dance in the river
    Dance in the river
    
    'Cause we're stirrin' up deep, deep wells
    We're stirrin' up deep, deep waters
    
    We're gonna jump in the river
    Jump in the river
  C: |
    Deep cries out to,
    deep cries out to You

    Deep cries out to,
    deep cries out to You

    We cry out to, 
    we cry out to You, Jesus
  B: |
    We're falling into deeper waters
    Calling out to You
    
    We're walking into deeper waters
    Going after You

    If He goes to the left, 
    then we'll go to the left

    And if He goes to the right,
    then we'll go to the right

    We're gonna jump, jump, jump, jump in the river
    Jump, jump, jump, jump, everybody

     If He goes to the left, 
    then we'll go to the left

    And if He goes to the right,
    then we'll go to the right
    
    We're gonna dance, dance, dance, dance in the river
    Dance, dance, dance, dance, everybody
    
    If He goes to the left, 
    then we'll go to the left

    And if He goes to the right,
    then we'll go to the right
    
    We're gonna shout, shout, shout, shout in the river
    Shout, shout, shout, shout
