  V1: |
    You've overcome this world with love
    And made my fight Your own

    I lift my eyes and throw fear aside
    And sing out into the night

  C: |
    Even when the world caves
    Even when the fight calls
    
    Even when the war's waged
    I'll take heart

    I know You are greater
    Forever You are Savior
    
    I will sing Your praise
    With all that I have

    With all that I am Lord

  V2: |
    I'll stare down the waves
    'Cause You own the tide

    I'll still my soul and know

    You wait for me on waters wild
    Where faith walks above the storm

  C2: |
    Even when the world caves
    Even when the fight calls
    
    Even when the war's waged
    I'll take heart

    I know You are greater
    Forever You are Savior
    
    I will sing Your praise

    With all that I have
    With all that I am Lord

    With all that I have
    With all that I am Lord

  B: |
    I won't let the storm weather my heart
    Won't let the darkness beat me down

    Sing in the night my hope alive in You

    I'll walk through the fire and not be burned
    Pray in the fight and watch it turn

    Jesus tonight I give it all to You
