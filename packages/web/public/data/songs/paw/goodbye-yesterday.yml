  V1: |
    Goodbye yesterday
    I'm living in the light of a new day
  
    I won't waste another minute in my old ways
    Praise the Lord I've been born again

  C: |
    Again and again and again and again
    You rescued me out of the mess I was in

    Traded my sorrow for something to sing
    I'm dancing on the grave that I once lived in

  V2: |
    Goodbye yesterday
    The Spirit of the Lord is upon me

    I've got resurrection in my veins
    Praise the Lord, I've been born again

  B: |
    I have decided
    To follow Jesus

    The world behind
    The cross before

    I won't turn back
