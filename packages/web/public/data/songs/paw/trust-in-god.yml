  V1: |
    Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine

    He's been my fourth man
    in the fire, time after time

    Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood

    And what He did for me on Calvary 
    is more than enough

  C: |
    I trust in God, my Savior, 
    the One Who will never fail

    He will never fail

  V2: |
    Perfect submission, all is at rest

    I know the Author of tomorrow
    has ordered my steps

    So this is my story, and this is my song
    Praising my risen King and Savior all the day long

  B: |
    I sought the Lord,
    and He heard, and He answered
    
    That's why I trust Him
