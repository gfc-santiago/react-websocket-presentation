  V1: |
    When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
    when sorrows like sea billows roll;
    
    whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,
    It is well, it is well with my soul.

  R:  |
    It is well with my soul,
    it is well, it is well with my soul.

  V2: |
    Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
    let this blest assurance control,
    
    that Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
    and hath shed his own blood for my soul.
  
  V3: |
    My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
    My sin, not in part but the whole,
    
    is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
    praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

  V4: |
    And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
    the clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
    
    the trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
    even so, it is well with my soul.
