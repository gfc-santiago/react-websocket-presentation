  V1: |
    To God be the glory,
    great things he hath done!

    So loved he the world
    that he gave us his Son

    who yielded his life
    an atonement for sin

    and opened the life-gate
    that all may go in

  C: |
    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
    let the earth hear his voice!

    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
    let the people rejoice!

    O come to the Father
    thru Jesus the Son

    and give him the glory,
    great things he hath done!

  V2: |
    O perfect redemption,
    the purchase of blood

    to every believer
    the promise of God

    the vilest offender
    who truly believes

    that moment from Jesus
    a pardon receives

  V3: |
    Great things he hath taught us
    great things he hath done

    and great our rejoicing
    thru Jesus the Son

    but purer, and higher
    and greater will be

    our wonder, our transport,
    when Jesus we see.
