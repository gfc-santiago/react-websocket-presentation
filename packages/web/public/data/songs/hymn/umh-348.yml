  V1: |
    Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,
    calling for you and for me;
    
    see, on the portals he's waiting and watching,
    watching for you and for me.

  R: |
    Come home, come home; 
    you who are weary come home;

    earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,
    calling, O sinner, come home!

  V2: |
    Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading,
    pleading for you and for me?

    Why should we linger and heed not his mercies,
    mercies for you and for me?
  
  V3: |
    Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing,
    passing from you and from me;
    
    shadows are gathering, deathbeds are coming,
    coming for you and for me.

  V4: |
    O for the wonderful love he has promised,
    promised for you and for me!
    
    Though we have sinned, he has mercy and pardon,
    pardon for you and for me.
