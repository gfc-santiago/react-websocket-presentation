  V1: |
    O for a thousand tongues to sing
    my great Redeemer's praise, 
    
    the glories of my God and King,
    the triumphs of his grace!

  V2: |
    My gracious Master and my God,
    assist me to proclaim,
    
    to spread through all the earth abroad
    the honors of thy name.

  V3: |
    Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
    that bids our sorrows cease; 
    
    'tis music in the sinner's ears, 
    'tis life, and health, and peace.

  V4: |
    He breaks the power of canceled sin,
    he sets the prisoner free;

    his blood can make the foulest clean;
    his blood availed for me.

  V5: |
    He speaks, and listening to his voice,
    new life the dead receive;

    the mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
    the humble poor believe.

  V6: |
    Hear him, ye deaf; his praise, ye dumb,
    your loosened tongues employ;

    ye blind, behold your Savior come,
    and leap, ye lame, for joy.
    
  V7: |
    In Christ, your head, you then shall know,
    shall feel your sins forgiven;

    anticipate your heaven below,
    and own that love is heaven.
