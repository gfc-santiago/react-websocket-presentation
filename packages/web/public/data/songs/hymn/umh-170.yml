  V1: |
    There is a name I love to hear,
    I love to sing its worth;
    
    it sounds like music in my ear,
    the sweetest name on earth.

  R: |
    O how I love Jesus,
    O how I love Jesus,

    O how I love Jesus,
    because he first loved me!

  V2: |
    It tells me of a Savior's love,
    who died to set me free;
    
    it tells me of his precious blood,
    the sinner's perfect plea.

  V3: |
    It tells of one whose loving heart
    can feel my deepest woe;
    
    who in each sorrow bears a part
    that none can bear below.
