  V1: |
    Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father;
    there is no shadow of turning with thee

    thou changest not, thy compassions, they fail not
    as thou hast been, thou forever wilt be.

  C: |
    Great is thy faithfulness! Great is thy faithfulness!
    Morning by morning new mercies I see

    all I have needed thy hand hath provided
    great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!

  V2: |
    Summer and winter and springtime and harvest
    sun, moon, and stars in their courses above

    join with all nature in manifold witness
    to thy great faithfulness, mercy, and love

  V3: |
    Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth
    thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide

    strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow
    blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!
