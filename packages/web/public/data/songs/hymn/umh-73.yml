  V1: |
    O worship the King
    all glorious above

    O gratefully sing
    God's power and God's love

    Our Shield and Defender,
    the Ancient of Days,

    Pavilioned in splendor,
    and girded with praise.

  V2: |
    O tell of God's might
    O sing of God's grace

    whose robe is the light
    whose canopy space

    whose chariots of wrath
    the deep thunderclouds form

    And dark is God's path
    on the wings of the storm.

  V3: |
    The earth with its store
    of wonders untold

    Almighty, thy power
    hath founded of old

    hath stablished it fast
    by a changeless decree

    and round it hath cast
    like a mantle, the sea.

  V4: |
    Thy bountiful care,
    what tongue can recite?

    It breathes in the air,
    it shines in the light

    it streams from the hills,
    it descends to the plain

    and sweetly distills in
    the dew and the rain.

  V5: |
    Frail children of dust,
    and feeble as frail,

    in thee do we trust,
    nor find thee to fail

    thy mercies how tender,
    how firm to the end,

    our Maker, Defender,
    Redeemer, and Friend.
