  V1: |
    Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
    let me hide myself in thee;

    let the water and the blood,
    from thy wounded side which flowed,
    
    be of sin the double cure;
    save from wrath and make me pure.

  V2: |
    Not the labors of my hands
    can fulfill thy law's demands
    
    could my zeal no respite know,
    could my tears forever flow,
    
    all for sin could not atone;
    thou must save, and thou alone.
  
  V3: |
    Nothing in my hand I bring,
    simply to the cross I cling;
    
    naked, come to thee for dress;
    helpless, look to thee for grace;
    
    foul, I to the fountain fly;
    wash me, Savior, or I die.
  
  V4: |
    While I draw this fleeting breath,
    when mine eyes shall close in death,

    when I soar to worlds unknown,
    see thee on thy judgment throne,


    Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
    let me hide myself in thee. 
    
    Amen.
