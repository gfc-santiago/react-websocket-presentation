      {xs}Liturgist:
      In the beginning, God called the
      world into being, saying,

      {xs}People:
      “Let there be light!”

      {xs}Liturgist:
      In the fullness of time,
      Jesus came from God to us, saying,

      {xs}People:
      “I am the Light of the world.”

      {xs}Liturgist:
      In our everyday life,
      we see the work of the saints,

      {xs}People:
      The ones in whom God’s light shines.

      {xs}Liturgist:
      So let us give thanks for the saints this day,

      {xs}People:
      And let us worship God.

      {xs}Liturgist:
      We gather this morning to remember our call

      {xs}People:
      To do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with God.

      {xs}Liturgist:
      We bring with us the events of the
      week in the world and in our lives,

      {xs}People:
      Trying to know how to be just and
      loving and humble in the midst of it all.

      {xs}Liturgist:
      We gather here, and see those
      who are doing justice,

      {xs}Liturgist:
      who are kind beyond measure,
      who set the example for humility.

      {xs}All:
      With gratitude for living saints, with thankfulness
      for the purpose of faith, let us worship God.

      Opening Prayer
      {xs}(The Community in Unison)
  
      Eternal God, hope of all who trust in you,
      in Christ you weep with those who mourn
      
      even as you cry out in triumph over the grave.
      Unbind us from sin, release us from captivity,
      
      and with Lazarus, raise us from death to life,
      so that we may join that great crowd of saints
      
      who forever sing praise to your holy name;
      through Christ, the resurrection and the life.
