      Children of God, prepare the way!

      and from generations past, urging us to prepare
      
      {xs}Liturgist:
      and refine our hearts for the coming
      of the Word of God. Are you listening?

      to receive God's Word among us.

      {xs}Liturgist:
      Children of God, this is the mark of our preparation:
      that passion for God's Word would burn within us,

      {xs}Liturgist:
      cleansing us and renewing us to reflect
      God's love throughout the world.

      Opening Prayer
      {xs}(The Community in Unison)
  
      Compassionate God, greet us with your grace this day,
      for we need you. We cannot save ourselves.
      
      Though we may be frantic with activity,
      our efforts do not yield peace, peace as you can give.
      
      Today we would be quiet enough to hear your voice.
      Today we would be still enough to feel your touch.
      
      Help us to find that place where we can receive
      as well as give, wait as well as act, and listen as well as speak.
      
      Our whole world needs your peace.

      Let us come before you and learn your ways,
      laying down our weapons and feeding the hungry.
      
      Come to us now, through Jesus the Christ. Amen.

      {sm} (Congregation in unison)
      Loving God, in this Advent season,
      we bring our offerings with hearts open to your call.
      
      Just as John the Baptist prepared the way for Jesus,
      may our gifts help prepare the way for your kingdom.
      
      Use these offerings to bring hope,
      justice, and transformation.

      Help us to look beyond the surface,
      to see your work in surprising places and people.
      
      Bless our giving, that it may shine
      with the presence of Emmanuel. 
      
      In Christ's name, we pray. Amen.
