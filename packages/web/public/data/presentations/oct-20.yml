      {xs}Liturgist:
      Welcome all who long to encounter Jesus, 
      the one who loves,tends, sustains, and saves us.

      {xs}People:
      Jesus said, 
      “The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve.”

      {xs}Liturgist:
      Welcome all who walk the halls of power, who feel pushed
      and pulled to fight for position, status, and authority.

      {xs}People:
      Jesus said, 
      “The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve.”

      {xs}Liturgist:
      Welcome all who feel burned out,
      who have given more than they have day in and day out 
      
      {xs}Liturgist:
      and long for someone to notice that you,
      too, need help and support.

      {xs}People:
      Jesus said, 
      “The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve.”

      {xs}Liturgist:
      Welcome, followers of Christ, who came to serve
      and show God’s abundant love and grace among us.

      {xs}People:
      We come to worship Jesus who shows us
      that serving is the fruit of our love 
      
      {xs}People:
      and being served by one another is the source
      of our power as the Body of Christ. Amen.

      Opening Prayer
      {xs}(Community In Unison)

      Though you are God, with all the influence
      and status that the name implies,
      
      you refused to pull rank,
      and parade your power among us.
      
      Instead, you chose to step down
      into our experience, living among us,
      
      as one of us, with all the struggle and suffering
      that goes with being human.

      More than that, you adopted the role of servant,
      washing feet, serving people of no reputation
      
      or social standing, 
      and giving of yourself completely.
      
      As incredible as it sounds,
      you are the God who serves,
      
      and we can respond in no other way
      than to give ourselves to you in praise.
      
      Amen.
